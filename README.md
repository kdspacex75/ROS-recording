# ROS2 Trajectory Recording ðŸš—ðŸ“¡

ROS2 project to record robot trajectories, apply dead-reckoning, and compare against ground truth.

## Features
- Recorded bagfiles for multiple trajectories by modifying waypoints
- Implemented **dead-reckoning** algorithm
- Plotted X, Y, and heading (estimated vs ground truth)

## Tech Stack
- ROS2 Jazzy
- Python
- Gazebo Simulation

## Demo
(Add screenshots of your plots or robot in Gazebo here!)
